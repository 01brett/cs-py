#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - the n^3 in the while loop is cut down to n by the n^2 in the iteration addition

b) O(n \* 1/2n) - the initial for loop n times with an inner loop running in 1/2 n times.

c) O(n) - the recursive func will decrement itself linearly for as many as n times

## Exercise II
